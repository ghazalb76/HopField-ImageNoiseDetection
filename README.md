# HopField-ImageNoiseDetection

Design a Hopfield Network and train it on the images of the first 10 letters of English alphabet to get a
noisy image and correct it. In order to test my model, noise has been added to X percent of each of the images and
then they have been given to the network. In the end networkâ€™s accuracy has been calculated.
